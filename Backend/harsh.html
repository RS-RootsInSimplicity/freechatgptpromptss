      <h4>CREATE A HYPER-DETAILED GRAPHIC DESIGN FEATURING A STRIKING PORTRAIT OF A YOUNG MAN WITH THE SAME FACE AS [USER UPLOADED] WITH A CONFIDENT DEMEANOUR. HIS HEAD IS ADORNED WITH VOLUMINOUS, ADDING TEXTURE AND DEPTH TO THE COMPOSITION. THE PORTRAIT IS RENDERED IN A HIGH-CONTRAST BLACK-AND-WHITE STYLE, STANDING OUT AGAINST THE MINIMALIST BACKGROUND. HIS EXPRESSION IS CALM YET DETERMINED, WITH ONE EYE PARTIALLY OBSCURED BY A BOLD RED RECTANGULAR OVERLAY THAT ADDS A MODERN, ARTISTIC FLAIR.
THE BACKGROUND IS A SMOOTH, TEXTURED GREY CANVAS, SERVING AS A NEUTRAL BACKDROP THAT ENHANCES THE FOCAL ELEMENTS. OVERLAID VERTICALLY ALONG THE LEFT SIDE OF THE IMAGE, THE WORD "VRBVFX" IS REPEATED IN LARGE, BOLD BLACK LETTERS WITH A SLIGHT TRANSPARENCY EFFECT, CREATING A LAYERED, DYNAMIC LOOK. INTERSPERSED WITHIN THIS TEXT ARE ICONIC DESIGN ELEMENTS: A PROMINENT NIKE LOGO IN RED NEAR THE TOP, A STYLIZED RED "S" LOWER DOWN, AND A VERTICAL RED LINE THAT PUNCTUATES THE DESIGN. TO THE RIGHT, A RED GEOMETRIC FRAME SURROUNDS THE OBSCURED EYE, DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE INTERPLAY OF COLOUR AND FORM.
AT THE BOTTOM RIGHT, THE PHRASE "WORK SMART NOT HARD" IS WRITTEN IN BOLD RED CAPITAL LETTERS, WITH "SMART" IN A SMALLER, ELEGANT CURSIVE SCRIPT. BENEATH IT SIGNED OFF WITH "GRAPHICS" IN A MATCHING STYLE, SUGGESTING A PERSONAL OR BRAND SIGNATURE. THE BOTTOM LEFT CORNER FEATURES THE HASHTAG "#vrbvfx" IN RED, REINFORCING THE IDENTITY THEME.
THE YOUNG MAN'S ATTIRE, A PARTIALLY VISIBLE BLACK LEATHER JACKET WITH AN OPEN COLLAR, ADDS A RUGGED YET STYLISH EDGE TO THE OVERALL AESTHETIC.
THE LIGHTING IS SOFT YET DRAMATIC, HIGHLIGHTING THE TEXTURES OF HIS HAIR AND JACKET. WHILE THE RED ACCENTS POP VIVIDLY AGAINST THE GRAYSCALE TONES, CREATING A COHESIVE, HIGH-ENERGY VISUAL THAT BLENDS STREETWEAR CULTURE WITH GRAPHIC ARTISTRY. PHOTOREALISTIC, SHALLOW DEPTH OF FIELD, HIGH-RESOLUTION DSLR QUALITY, HASSELBLAD X2D 100C, SHALLOW DEPTH OF FIELD, SHARPLY FOCUSED ON 4:5 ASPECT RATIO. MAKE IT 8K ULTRA REALISTIC.
